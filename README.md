# Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning


## Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based spam email classification model using scikit-learn, NLTK, NumPy, and pandas in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) format.

## Features
- **Dataset:** Utilizes a curated dataset of spam and legitimate emails.
- **Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses email text using NLTK for tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
- **Modeling:** Implements multiple machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) for classification.
- **Evaluation:** Measures model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
